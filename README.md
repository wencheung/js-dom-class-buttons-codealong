# Classy Buttons Code Along!

## Make it purple. 
Allow the user to click on the "Make it purple" button to toggle on/off a purple background with white text within the div that contains the word `Radical`.

## Make it rain.
Using innerHTML, allow the user to click on the "Make it rain" button to insert images of dollar bills every time the button is clicked. 

### STRETCH
Code other types of event listeners for the buttons. Consider trying: 
* "mouseover"
* "mouseout"
* "mousemove"
* "dblclick"

## Make it go crazy.
You'll notice the last button doesn't have any specifications. You get to decide the NAME of this class, and the styling that it applies. You'll need to modify the CSS file AND the javascript file.
